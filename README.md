# wooden-fortifications
A mod for Vintage Story that adds various wooden fortifications and defences

Mod Link: https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/mod/7017

Vintage Story doesn't have much in the way of passive base defense, so I set out to rectify that with some simple crude additions available from day 1.

Current fortifications:

    Sharpened wooden stakes (Archer's Stakes)
        Crafted with 4 firewood
        Has 25 hit points before it self destructs
        Deals 2 damage
    Embedded copper spears (Archer's Copper Spears)
        Crafted with Archer's Stakes and a single copper spearhead
        Has a longer lasting 60 hit points
        Deals 3 damage
    Palisade Walls
        Crafted with 6 firewood
        Two blocks high
    Palisade Walls with Walkway
        Crafted with 7 firewood
        Two blocks high with walkway

Planned:

    More spear stakes to expand to all metal types
    Better collisions for palisade walls
    Integration with world-generated palisade and spikes

Known Issues:

    Despite the visual, palisade walls don't currently seem to block projectiles above the first block. I am looking into how to rectify this
    Players will sometimes not take damage while touching spikes after the first impact. I probably won't fix this.
